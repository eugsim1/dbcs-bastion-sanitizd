### what this terraform project is creating ?
1 bastion with 2 backend web servers + one loadbalancer
Bastion is on public reg subnet
backend servers on private subnet not used

dbcs can be in public or in private networks
loadbalancer in public 

dataguard > local vnc works only with explicit vcn rules not with nsg


create  terraform.tfvars

there are some variables that they can setup to create the bastion, the backend servers, the database , the dataguard ... etc etc
this is a living project so excpet the code to move on quickly

Some parts are copied and modified from other Oracle tf modules, some other part are rewritten

You might find public and private keys ... 
So please please dont be a jack***s to run stupid anonymous scripts to gather the keys and report trying to make your self famous or get some bucks from wherever
the keys are generated everytime the project is run so dont try to report you get nothing but useless pain

the infos that you might find , or believe that will shown you secrets on Oracle cloud dont exist here

this is a personal project with no links or support from any company
