### what this terraform project is creating ?
1 bastion with 2 backend web servers + one loadbalancer
Bastion is on public reg subnet
backend servers on private subnet / the can provision nginx with wildcard certs / or node.js => for the node.js i have to install code to reply to requests
dbcs can be in public or in private networks
loadbalancer in public 
certs => several wildcarts certs for the loadbalancer to setup ssl scenarios => ssl termination / end2end ssl ...
dataguard > local vnc works only with explicit vcn rules not with nsg


How you can you it ?

there is a terraform.tfvars

there are some variables that they can setup to create the bastion, the backend servers, the database , the dataguard ... etc etc
this is a living project so excpet the code to move on quickly

Some parts are copied and modified from other Oracle tf modules, some other part are rewritten

You might find public and private keys ... so please please dont be a jack***s to run stupid anonymous scripts to gather the keys and report them wherever trying to make your seld famous or get some bucks from wherever 
the keys are generated everytime the project is run so dont try to report you get nothing but useless pain

the infos that you might find , or believe that will shown you secrets on Oracle cloud dont exist here

this is a personal project with no links or support from any company 


### security features
the network module setup:
 a waaf security list
 a dbcs nsg list => bastion + dbcs are linked with 2 nsg groups
